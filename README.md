SQL Window Functions Project:
-----------------------------

This project demonstrates the use of SQL Window Functions to analyze employee data. It was built collaboratively as part of our coursework. All queries were written using SQL, and the dataset simulates a company's employee information.

Dataset Description
-------------------
We used a fictional employees table with the following columns:


Column	  |Description
---------------------------------------------------
id: Employee ID
name: Employee Name
department: Department name
salary: Monthly salary in USD
join_date: Date the employee joined

Query 1: Compare Salary with Previous and Next
Objective:
Use LAG() and LEAD() to compare each employeeâ€™s salary to their previous and next colleague (by salary).

SQL:

SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    department,
    salary,
    LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS previous_salary,
    LEAD(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS next_salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary > LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) THEN 'HIGHER'
        WHEN salary < LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) THEN 'LOWER'
        ELSE 'EQUAL'
    END AS compared_to_previous
FROM employees;

Application:
Used in salary growth tracking, performance reviews, or bonus eligibility analysis.

Query 2: Ranking Employees Within Each Department
Objective:
Compare RANK() vs DENSE_RANK() for employees grouped by department and sorted by salary.
